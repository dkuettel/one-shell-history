next:
- agg search or reverse search for current folder instead of current session
    - easy to find something project relevant
    - generally a way to filter also based on folder? if not here but know what it was
- smart reuse: use selected command, but translate paths to work for where you are now
    - since we know the original path it was executed in
- readme should mention posh - powered by osh, searching since before you were bourne
- complete/search files/paths from history?
    - sometimes cd to complicated folder cant be searched because we hide cd
    - (but we could go to non-ignored search)
    - generally parse and get most-used files and paths?
- what about knowing about aliases, search also the expanded version?
o I dont know what happens when we ctrl-z into background, does it think the command ended, what hooks are called?
    - that seems to be code 148, do we want to filter them differently?
    - also fg then is a command
    - the alternative would be to wrap it, but that seems nasty


nice to have:
- sanity checker for archive, see if any duplicates or stuff
    - especially if you copied one twice earlier and later they will have so much overlap, one should have more (into the future)
    - or based on an incoming file that you point at
- something to test the events-filter file to double check, or add/remove from cli


relevant:
- https://github.com/larkery/zsh-histdb
    - saves mostly the same data as osh
    - but not suited for easy synchronization, using a single sqlite db
