merging zsh_history and keeping both running with produce duplicates
we cant easily match them. should switch off when changing
maybe make an export too to feel more safe?

have some warning in daemon or somewhere when it sees an old-style history (growing)?
maybe use a heuristic to match in this case? time is close and command is exactly the same, machine? others are unset, duration is probably not the same either

zsh_history duration value doesnt seem to be accurate, always 0?

make session working too
maybe prioritize them in search, or in upkey?


also add session id for identifiable sequence
similar with machines?

maybe add "boring commands" and never log them
or never search for them?

sync, thru connections ssh
or thru git?
merging logic is easy
