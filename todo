next:
- esc in fzf makes it fail later, because we dont expect that key?
- bin/osh in path, symlink works?
- move master to main also on remote? I think yves needs to know then (?)
    - do it before anyone else uses it
- pylint


nice to have:
- logging? how does it play nice with systemd
    - how about when in direct mode, where we should be quiet
    - use structed logging
- https://github.com/dahlia/iterfzf is interesting
    - see as next step, check what it does
    - is there a better way to combine it? --preview could point to a python function, that would be even nicer
     - ok in our case we could do a request to the server, and maybe easy in linux because it's plain http
- sanity checker for archive, see if any duplicates or stuff
    - or based on an incoming file that you point at
- something to test the events-filter file to double check, or add/remove from cli
- version output or so, status of service or other things


sockets and streams:
- do I need to be more careful who closes stuff and who waits?
- like receiver says None when done with results, server stops producing, but server reading None might fail if client already closed?
- is it possible to wait for other side's close?


benchmark:
- pip install vmprof
- needed apt python-dev or python3.0-dev ?
- also needed libunwind-dev


relevant:
- https://github.com/larkery/zsh-histdb
    - saves mostly the same data as osh
    - but not suited for easy synchronization, using a single sqlite db
